- when the categorical variables have no order of magnitude between them, you should one-hot encode them
  - when there is you can map the options in a seq for example: 0, 1, 3 to represent different education levels
- pd.get_dummies() to one-hot encode them
  - pd.get_dummies(ccc_modified, columns=['marital_status']), this is a better way to call it to drop the original column
- StandardScaler works with numpy arrays
- After performing the cluster analysis you should analize the output with the original data.
  - For numerical variables, aggregate functions and scatter plots
    - groupby function is useful
  - For categorical variables, percentual distribution
    - crosstab
